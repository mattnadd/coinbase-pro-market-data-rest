Load and visualise Bitcoin market data from Coinbase Pro via Python andÂ REST

In case you want to get started as a crypto investor and you want to take matters into your own hands, it is important that you are able to connect to a currency exchange such as https://pro.coinbase.com. This is the essential first step to start data analysis and automation and move into algorithmic trading. In the attached Jupyter notebook you will learn the following:

- How to connect to the public coinbase.com pro REST API via Python
- How to load data from coinbase into Pandas
- How to visualize Bitcoin (or any other crypto currency) historic data in Python?

The example uses Coinbase Pro as an exchange but it should be easily transferable to the other major digital currency exchange Kraken. The full pro.coinbase.com documentation can be found here.
